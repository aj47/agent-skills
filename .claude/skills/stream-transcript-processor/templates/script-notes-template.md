## Usage Notes

1. **HOOK**: Must grab attention in first 3 seconds
   - Lead with result, not setup
   - Be specific (numbers, tool names)
   - Avoid: "so", "hey", "I wanted to share"

2. **VALUE STACK**: Quick benefit stacking
   - Each bullet is a sentence starter (ends with "...")
   - Use "just" to signal simplicity
   - Common value props: free, open source, local, fast

3. **DEMO**: Natural demonstration flow
   - "Let's see" / "Let's try" for inclusivity
   - Leave room for natural reactions
   - Don't script the reaction, just note where it goes

4. **CLOSE**: Action-oriented ending
   - Summarize in one line
   - CTA: "try it", "download", "check it out"
   - Never: "subscribe", "follow", "comment"
