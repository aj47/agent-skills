**Ideal Length:** 60-300 seconds (can be longer for complex demos)

**Key Indicators:**
- Opinion/thesis statements followed by "let me prove it"
- Demo or example execution

## Quality Criteria

### Technical Requirements

**Complete Thoughts:**
- Segment should have a clear beginning and end
- Avoid cutting mid-sentence or mid-topic
- Include necessary context for understanding

**Appropriate Length:**
- Minimum: 10 seconds (shorter clips lack context)
- Ideal: 15-45 seconds (perfect for short-form platforms)
- Maximum: 60 seconds (beyond this, engagement drops)

**Self-Contained:**
- Understandable without watching the full video
- Doesn't require knowledge of prior events
- Has sufficient context to stand alone

**Natural Boundaries:**
- Starts at a natural speech point (new topic, question, statement)
- Ends at a logical conclusion (answer complete, point made)
- Respects sentence and thought boundaries

### Content Quality

**Engaging Hook:**
- First 2-3 seconds should grab attention
- Opens with question, statement, or reaction
- Creates curiosity or immediate value

**Clear Value:**
- Viewer should gain something (knowledge, entertainment, insight)
- Has a clear purpose or message
- Worth the time investment

**Shareability:**
- Relatable to target audience
- Sparks conversation or reaction
- Has quotable moments

### Confidence Scoring

Assign confidence scores based on:

**0.9-1.0 (Excellent)**
- Multiple quality indicators present
- Strong hook and clear value
- Perfect length and boundaries
- High engagement potential

**0.7-0.8 (Good)**
- Several quality indicators
- Clear value proposition
- Appropriate length
- Solid engagement potential

**0.6-0.7 (Moderate)**
- Some quality indicators
- Decent value or entertainment
- Acceptable length
- Moderate engagement potential

**Below 0.6 (Skip)**
- Weak indicators
- Unclear value
- Poor boundaries or length
- Low engagement potential

## Edge Cases

### Multi-Category Segments

Some segments fit multiple categories:
- A funny teaching moment (humor + teaching)
- An enthusiastic recommendation (reaction + tip)
- A controversial explanation (opinion + teaching)

**Handle by:**
- Choose the dominant category
- Mention both in the reason field
- Weight confidence higher for multi-category clips

### Transitional Moments

Topic transitions can be good clip starts but need careful handling:
- Ensure sufficient context after the transition
- Don't start too abruptly
- Include 1-2 sentences before if needed for setup

### Interruptions and Tangents

Real conversations have interruptions:
- Skip segments with too many false starts
- Avoid clips with excessive "um," "uh," "like" filler
- Choose clean, coherent sections

### Reference-Heavy Content

Segments that reference earlier content:
- Include if the reference is explained in the clip
- Skip if understanding requires prior knowledge
- Consider expanding the clip to include the reference

## Platform Considerations

Different platforms favor different characteristics:

**TikTok / YouTube Shorts (15-60s):**
- High energy, quick hooks
- Entertainment and reactions perform well
- Teaching moments should be rapid-fire

**Instagram Reels (15-90s):**
- Slightly longer acceptable
- Visual moments (even if audio-only transcript)
- Tips and advice perform well

**Twitter / X (15-140s):**
- Hot takes and opinions excel
- News-worthy or controversial content
- Debate starters

**LinkedIn (30-180s):**
- Professional tips and advice
- Teaching moments and insights
- Industry-specific content

## Relationship: Individual Moments → Story Arcs

Individual moment categories often map to narrative beats:

| Individual Category | Common Beat Role |
|--------------------|------------------|
| **reaction** | RESOLUTION, CONFIRMATION, VERDICT |
| **tip** | EVIDENCE (in ARGUMENT), STEPS (in TUTORIAL) |
| **teaching** | STEPS, EVIDENCE, EXPLORE |
| **question** | Can trigger DISCOVERY arc |
| **humor** | Often standalone, rarely part of arc |
| **story** | Often maps to PROBLEM-SOLUTION arc |
| **opinion** | CLAIM, VERDICT, WINNER |

### Priority Order

When scoring and extracting clips, prioritize in this order:

1. **Complete Story Arcs** (highest value)
   - All required beats present
   - Narrative is self-contained
   - Score boost: +10 to +15

2. **Partial Story Arcs** (with gaps flagged)
   - 2+ beats present but missing key elements
   - Flag gaps for user review
   - Score: standard + partial boost

3. **High-Confidence Individual Moments** (0.85+)
   - Strong standalone value
   - May be orphan beats
   - Extract with orphan warning if applicable

4. **Medium-Confidence Individual Moments** (0.70-0.84)
   - Decent value, context-dependent
   - Consider for compilations

5. **Low-Confidence Moments** (0.60-0.69)
   - Include only if no better options
   - Often better as part of compilation

### Demo-First Scoring Adjustments

Apply these adjustments to base confidence:

| Content Type | Adjustment |
|--------------|------------|
| Complete demo with result | +0.15 |
| Demo in progress (no result yet) | +0.08 |
| Verbal claim with no demo | +0.00 |
| Orphan claim (no proof found) | -0.10 |
| Result without showing process | +0.05 |

### Orphan Detection

Flag segments as "orphan" when:

- **Orphan CLAIM**: Opinion/thesis with no EVIDENCE within 5 minutes
- **Orphan RESOLUTION**: Victory reaction with no preceding EVIDENCE
- **Orphan RESULT**: "It works!" with no GOAL or STEPS shown
- **Orphan VERDICT**: Assessment with no EXPLORE/TEST shown

Orphans should be:
1. Flagged in output with `is_orphan: true`
2. Still extracted (may have standalone value)
3. Reviewed for potential missed beats
