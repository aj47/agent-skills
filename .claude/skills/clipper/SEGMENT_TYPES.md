## Quality Criteria

### Technical Requirements

**Complete Thoughts:**
- Segment should have a clear beginning and end
- Avoid cutting mid-sentence or mid-topic
- Include necessary context for understanding

**Appropriate Length:**
- Minimum: 10 seconds (shorter clips lack context)
- Ideal: 15-45 seconds (perfect for short-form platforms)
- Maximum: 60 seconds (beyond this, engagement drops)

**Self-Contained:**
- Understandable without watching the full video
- Doesn't require knowledge of prior events
- Has sufficient context to stand alone

**Natural Boundaries:**
- Starts at a natural speech point (new topic, question, statement)
- Ends at a logical conclusion (answer complete, point made)
- Respects sentence and thought boundaries

### Content Quality

**Engaging Hook:**
- First 2-3 seconds should grab attention
- Opens with question, statement, or reaction
- Creates curiosity or immediate value

**Clear Value:**
- Viewer should gain something (knowledge, entertainment, insight)
- Has a clear purpose or message
- Worth the time investment

**Shareability:**
- Relatable to target audience
- Sparks conversation or reaction
- Has quotable moments

### Confidence Scoring

Assign confidence scores based on:

**0.9-1.0 (Excellent)**
- Multiple quality indicators present
- Strong hook and clear value
- Perfect length and boundaries
- High engagement potential

**0.7-0.8 (Good)**
- Several quality indicators
- Clear value proposition
- Appropriate length
- Solid engagement potential

**0.6-0.7 (Moderate)**
- Some quality indicators
- Decent value or entertainment
- Acceptable length
- Moderate engagement potential

**Below 0.6 (Skip)**

- Poor boundaries or length
- Low engagement potential

## Edge Cases

### Multi-Category Segments

Some segments fit multiple categories:
- A funny teaching moment (humor + teaching)
- An enthusiastic recommendation (reaction + tip)
- A controversial explanation (opinion + teaching)

**Handle by:**
- Choose the dominant category
- Mention both in the reason field
- Weight confidence higher for multi-category clips

### Transitional Moments

Topic transitions can be good clip starts but need careful handling:
- Ensure sufficient context after the transition
- Don't start too abruptly
- Include 1-2 sentences before if needed for setup

### Interruptions and Tangents

Real conversations have interruptions:
- Skip segments with too many false starts
- Avoid clips with excessive "um," "uh," "like" filler
- Choose clean, coherent sections

### Reference-Heavy Content

Segments that reference earlier content:
- Include if the reference is explained in the clip
- Skip if understanding requires prior knowledge
- Consider expanding the clip to include the reference

## Platform Considerations

Different platforms favor different characteristics:

**TikTok / YouTube Shorts (15-60s):**
- High energy, quick hooks
- Entertainment and reactions perform well
- Teaching moments should be rapid-fire

**Instagram Reels (15-90s):**
