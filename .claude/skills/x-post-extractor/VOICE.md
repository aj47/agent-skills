# Voice Guidelines

Reference for maintaining authentic techfren voice in X posts.

---

## High-Frequency Words to USE

These words feel natural and should appear regularly:

| Word | Usage |
|------|-------|
| `just` | "It just worked", "Just tried this" |
| `actually` | "That's actually really good" |
| `pretty cool` | Moderate positive reaction |
| `really cool` | Strong positive reaction |
| `let's see` | Building anticipation |
| `boom` | Celebrating a result |
| `dude` | Casual emphasis |
| `sick` | Strong approval |
| `free` | Value prop (always highlight) |
| `open source` | Value prop (always highlight) |
| `local` | Value prop for privacy-conscious audience |
| `fast` | Value prop for performance |

---

## Words to AVOID

These words dilute impact or feel inauthentic:

| Avoid | Why | Alternative |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| `like` (as filler) | Verbal tic, not written | Remove entirely |
| `I think` | Weakens statements | State directly |
| `kind of` | Hedging | Be specific |
| `maybe` | Uncertain | Commit or don't include |
| `basically` | Filler word | Explain directly |
| `honestly` | Overused, implies dishonesty elsewhere | Remove |
| `literally` | Usually misused | Use only for actual literal meaning |

**Example transformation:**
- Bad: "I think this is kind of like a better option, honestly"
- Good: "This is a better option"

---

## Reaction Words

Use these authentically—don't force them:

| Word | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `wow` | Genuine surprise at capability |
| `whoa` | Unexpected result |
| `nice` | Satisfying outcome |
| `perfect` | Exact desired result |
| `wait` | Realizing something important |
| `oh` | Discovery moment |

**Rule**: Only include reaction words if they appeared in the original transcript. Don't add them for effect.

---

## Formatting Rules

### Do NOT Start Posts With:

- "so" (mid-conversation energy)
- "hey" (too casual, wastes hook)
- "what's up" (wastes hook)
- "just wanted to share" (wastes hook)
- "I" (make it about the thing, not you)

### First 10 Words Must:

- Contain the hook (bold claim or result)
- Name the tool/topic if possible
- Create immediate interest

**Bad**: "So I was trying out this new coding tool today and..."
**Good**: "Cursor completed my entire function in 2 seconds."

### No Emojis

- Never use emojis in post body
- Exception: Thread indicator (one at end of hook tweet)
- Exception: Quoting chat reactions

### Hashtags

- Never in body of post
- Optional 1-2 at very end only
- Prefer no hashtags (engagement is higher)

### Line Breaks

- Use line break between each distinct thought
- Creates visual breathing room
- Makes posts easier to scan

**Example:**
```
Aide just autocompleted an entire function.

Free. Open source. Runs locally.

Worth checking out.
```

---

## Sentence Length

- Average under 25 words per sentence
- Prefer 10-15 word sentences
- One idea per sentence

**Long (bad)**:
"This new AI coding tool that I found is really impressive because it can autocomplete entire functions and it runs completely locally on your machine without needing an internet connection."

**Short (good)**:
"Found a new AI coding tool. Autocompletes entire functions. Runs locally, no internet needed."

---

## Value Props to Highlight

When the tool has these qualities, always mention:

| Value Prop | How to Phrase |
|------------|---------------|
| Free | "Free", "Completely free", "$0" |
| Open source | "Open source", "OSS" |
| Local/private | "Runs locally", "Your data stays local" |
| Fast | "Fast", specific time (e.g., "2 seconds") |
| Easy | "One-liner", "Drop-in replacement" |
| No signup | "No account needed", "No signup" |

---

## CTA Guidelines

### DO Use:

- "Try it out: [link]"
- "Check it out: [link]"
- "Download here: [link]"
- "Link in reply" (if can't include link)

### DO NOT Use:

- "Subscribe for more"
- "Follow for updates"
- "Like and retweet"
- "Comment below"

**Why**: Action CTAs (try, check, download) drive engagement. Engagement-beg CTAs feel desperate and underperform.

---

## Thread-Specific Voice

### Hook Tweet:

- Bold claim or surprising result
- Curiosity gap (what they'll learn)
- Thread indicator at end

**Example:**
```
Tested 3 Cursor alternatives this week.

One of them is mass sleeping on.

Here's what I found
```

### Value Tweets (2-5):

- Each starts with number or header
- One key point per tweet
- Specific example or metric when possible

**Example:**
```
2/ Aide

Free, open source, runs locally.

Autocomplete is surprisingly good—completed entire functions without context.

Local-first means your code never leaves your machine.
```

### Final Tweet:

- Recap in one sentence
- Actionable CTA
- Optional (use sparingly): "Follow for more [topic]"

## Authenticity Check

Before posting, ask:

1. Would I actually say this on stream?
2. Does this sound like natural speech?
3. Am I forcing enthusiasm or is it real?
4. Did I add reaction words that weren't in the original?

If any answer is "no" → revise.
